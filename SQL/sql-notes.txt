Database:
	consider  database as a container where an all the data is stored .The database is basically a systematic collection of the data which suppose to storage and manipulation of the data that you stored

c>create
u>update
r>read
D> delete

DBMS:	
	collection of programs which enables users to access database, manipulate data and represent data, A technology to store and retrive data with utmost efficiency along with appropirate security measures.
----------------
TYPES OF DBMS:

* hierarchial
-style of parent child  relationship to store the data
-it has a structure like tree with nodes
EG: windows Registry used in window-XP

* network
-supports many to many dbs
-complex
EG:RDMS

*RElational  DBMS
defines reationships in the form of tables also known as relations
mySQL

*Object oriented DBMS
-in the form of objects
EG: post SQL
-----------
ADV of DBMS

-	improved data sharing
-	improved Dats security
-	Reduction in data redundancy
-	minimized data inconsistency
-	interaction with user




----------Disadv
-inceased costs
-compleity of backup and recovery
-frequent upgrade


-------------
DBMS which organize and store the data by following the relational model is known as RDBMS
-Relational model is designed by E.F CODD
-In relational model all the data is stored in the form of relations
-a/c to codd data in r-model should be logically organized and stored in the form of tables

----TABLE----

-table is a logical organization of data and consits of rows and columns
-verical-column-used to represent the property of entity, Horizantal-row also called as tuples.
-row is used to represent the property of all the individual entity
-intesection of row en column generates the cell
-cell is the smallest unit of table which is used to store the data

---

RDBMS can be used to validate in two ways

-constraints
-datatypes
___________
Constraints
>NOTNULL
>UNIQUE
>FOREGIN KEY
>PRIMARY KEY
>CHECK
>DEFAULT

-----------
NOTNULL

>conatraints  restricts a column from having a NULL value. once you applies NOTNULL costraints to a column you cannot pass a null vallue to that column
>it cannot be applicable on tale level
-----
UNIQUE

>Unique  constraints ensure that a field or column will only have unique values,will not have an duplicate data
>can be apppllied at column level
---------
primary key

>this constraints uniquelyidentifes
each record n the database
>
>
prrimary key must cntaio=
>>CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMARY KEY

-	combo of
-
-can have only primary key
__ it is not mandtory to have primarykey in the table but it is recommend

-----------
table in which foregin kyey is present is known as child table
a table in which actually belongs<primary> is known as parent table
-foregin key must and should be defined as primary key in its parent table
- a column assigned as a foregin key terminal can accept duplicates or null values
